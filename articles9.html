								<h3><center>THE GRACE THAT NEVER FAILS</center><hr></h3>
								<p>There is a <strong>Grace</strong> <em>that never fails</em> or in other words I can also say, <em>the promises that never fails</em>. Before we dig deep into the article proper I want us to know and understand what Grace is?</p>
								<p><strong>What is Grace? <br>
<em>Grace is the beginning or re-awakening of great things in the middle of great things where greatness or goodness is not merited.
</em></strong> </p>
<p><em>Permit me to tell you little about a fact; oh! I remember the lineage I’m from, particularly the genealogy of my family. I know without any contradiction based of the ethics of practice there, it knows nothing <strong>God</strong>-inclined but chronic idolatry and I remember the fight for my life just to become a high priest for satan out of all the first children in the extended family, satan demanded for my life despite having two senior first children ahead. But just imagine, that child was unable to be initiated, that each and every time they tried <strong>God</strong> scatters their plans always, for the <strong>Lord has chosen</strong> this child to be an <strong>incorruptible seed</strong> (a house) <strong>for Himself </strong> from a <strong>land of corruption. This is a typical illustration of the Grace I am referring.</strong> </em> </p>
<p>There are different definitions and forms that refers to Grace by man but the Grace I’m exposing us to, is the Grace (Jesus) that never fails. This reminds me of a testimony I had throughout my years in the university. I know of my colleagues who are better at reading, faster in assimilation and remembering things more than I do and surprisingly I knew of some of them that had issues with one or more course but because of this <strong><em>Grace</em></strong> of concern, I did not have issues with any by the time I graduated. It is not that there are no challenges on the way but I overcame them. Glory to Jesus.</p>
<p><strong>NB: This is not to mock anyone, so please let no man misconstrue this.</strong>
<br> Also I need to establish this fact to you: Grace is not just an attribute but <em><strong>Grace is a personality called Christ Jesus.</strong></em> He is the Grace that never fails and to establish this let us do some studies: Looking at the life of Apostle Paul in 1 Cor. 15:10;<br> <em><strong>But by the Grace of God I am what I am: and his grace which was bestowed upon me was not in vain; but I laboured more abundantly than they all; yet not I, but the Grace of God which was with me.</strong> </em>
</p>
<p>This verse made me to understand something spectacular, an acknowledgement of a fact that all must understand. Apostle Paul was talking about getting to the level he got to not by virtue of mistake but by the encounter of something called <strong><em>Grace of God </em> </strong> and with boldness declaring it repeatedly to a point he said …. <em>but the<strong>Grace of God </strong> which was with me.</em> </p>
<p>Let me tell you that <em>any grace</em> we claim to be <em>walking in</em> which does not bring about the edification, sharpening of our destinies and the destinies of people we encounter, to bring out the glory of <strong>God</strong>as it is written in heaven, <em>is a bondage.</em> Also any Grace that gives you the license to continue in sin and not overcoming it, is a bondage. <strong><em>So Grace is a perfect encounter of God himself to man to bring about perfection in him.</em> </strong> </p>
<p>The question that kept me disturbed is; “how can we encountered this <strong>Grace of God?</strong>” <br> <em> Titus 2:11-12; says “For the <strong>Grace of God that bringeth salvation hath appeared to all men</strong> , teaching us that, denying ungodliness and worldly lusts, we should live soberly, righteously, and godly, in this present world” So let me tell you this simple truth: <strong>God is a just God</strong> and Jesus has and will appear to all men whether male or female, young or old in one way or the other, so there is no excuse anyone who find itself a failure and end up in hell.  </em> This verse made it clear that Jesus cannot be faulted for any life who decided on its own to perish because He who brought salvation has appeared to him/her one away or the other irrespective of the present status of that life.</p>
<p>For Paul all he knew about God was the grace of working in the Law of Moses that brings man with partial understanding to be compelled of the rule of sin and death which man was even a failure in, according to heaven’s order until he met the Grace that does not fail on his way to Damascus.
<br> <strong>NB: The Grace of God doesn’t imply the absence of difficulties, situations, challenges but He implies victory over all. Also where there is Grace of God there will always be challenges which is meant for growth.</strong><br>
Earlier I shared about my success during my undergraduate programme in the university but that does not mean I did not face challenges. Let me share this peculiar one; when I was in 200level, I remember I offered a course FRN221. I saw the result when it came from the French department to the result coordination officer, I knew I passed the course excellently but when the result got to my department and I went to check, I was told by my Head of department (HOD) that it was missing and that I should write a letter through our French lecturer to the department but something within me keep telling me not to bother that I passed excellently and concentrate on the courses that are next and I remember when I was checking my 300level first semester results my HOD told us (I was not the only one) to go and re-register for the course to avoid issues when graduating but by doing that, it means I carried over the course which I didn’t and I pray using a testimony my mom once shared with me when she was doing her NCE program. I prayed through this <strong> Grace </strong> who gave me the admission and course I’m studying to prove Himself <strong> God. The key was; I did not fail and I will not re-write any course because Jesus never fails.</strong> And I remember this. went on to my 400level but glory to this <strong>Grace that never fails </strong> that by the time I’m doing my clearance the course result has been recorded and cleared. I never wrote any letter, I didn’t re-write or re-register for the course but <strong><em>I knew it was Grace that has proved Himself.</em></<strong></strong> </p>
<p><strong>Also for Paul the Apostle according to 2 Cor. 12:4-11, it was realised that there were times he had challenges with his living even after he had encountered the Grace of God and longeth for God’s hand to deliver him from the challenge he had; but the only response He received from God was the Grace he has already received is sufficient for him.
</strong><br>We all need to have an encounter with this <strong> Grace of God that never fails.</strong> Let me tell you this fact I learnt from a great man, a mentor; the Grace himself and another man touched by this Grace, Apostle Joshua Selman, “Nothing in the kingdom of God just happens by mistake”.
</p>
<p>Note: Another definition of the <strong> Grace of God is God’s</strong> personality revealed to man by man as a result
	of His word or instruction. This can be confirmed in Cols. 1:6 “……, and knew the <strong>Grace of God </strong>in truth:
	” Man can only know this<strong> Grace of God </strong> in the personality called <strong>Truth (Grace of God </strong>is embedded in truth).
	This brings me to another question: Who is this personality called truth?<strong><em> He is simply Jesus; </strong> John 14:6 says
	 “Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, <strong>the truth</strong> and the life; …….”</em> <strong>Jesus is the Truth where the Grace of God
	 can only be found</strong>. Remember John 3:16, <strong>“God </strong>so loved the world, that He gave His only begotten Son, ………”.
	 I have the confidence to tell you that he did not fail in all areas of life but attained perfection just has
	 our father in heaven wanted our living, becoming the first born of perfection and through death gave unto us
	 perfection i.e never to be a failure in “ALL” areas of our lives.</p>
	 <p> <strong>WHAT does this Grace of God brought that made it also possible for man never to fail God his creator in all areas of life again?</strong> <hr>
		 	<strong>	 1.Salvation: -</strong> This means to be saved from failure (sin). NB: sin is the failure of man to be obedient in totality to <strong>God’s</strong> word or instruction. Jesus being the <strong>Grace of God</strong> bought for all man the ability to live a life without sin in all ramification of one’s life. “Let me tell you this which my master taught me; <em><strong>it is possible for you to be perfect. If it is not so, I would not have come to show you”</strong> but for a man born by the intercourse of man and woman, you need to grow in the perfection of me (Christ Jesus). Titus 2:11</em>
<br><br>	<strong>2.	Sustainance: - </strong>When you have seen the <strong>Grace of God;</strong> He will not just save you and leave you like that; but rather empower you with the knowledge of<strong> God </strong> and make you a good man by giving you his Spirit in fullness that your faith is not corrupted and He will take you to the street called straight. Act 11:24, Acts 9:11
<br><br><strong>	3.	Recommendation: -</strong> He recommends you before Heaven and before man.  Acts 9:10-11
<br><br><strong>	4.	Rejoicing (joy) and Gladness: - </strong>He brings to man rejoicing and gladness
	<br><br><strong>5.	Success: - </strong>Success goes beyond having a car, owning a company, having a big mansion or billions of possession. Success means being relevant to your generation and generations to come, through the impact you had on them while you are on earth.
	There are many more but I will only talk on one more which is of great importance;
<br><br><strong>	6.	Eternal life: -</strong> Jesus gives man life, a perfection that brings unlimited joy in Heaven before the father because Jesus Himself is life.
	<br><br>Therefore; let me ask, why does man need to continue in failure (sin, fear, hatred, pride, anger, little or no result)? When there is already a provision for us in Christ Jesus.
 </p>
 <p>Come unto Him today, He calls us, He loves us, He want to be with us, He died for us for this sake. Invite Him into your life today if you have never done that and face your failure(s) for victory. I am facing my failures now and I know victory is already in my boat. What about you? Matthew 11:28 says <em>“Come unto me, <strong>all ye that labour and are heavy laden</strong>, and I will <strong>give you rest”</strong>.</em></p>
<p>If you are taking that decision today kindly say this with me; Lord Jesus I accept you today, come into my life, forgive me all my sins, I know you died for me and resurrected for me to have the assurance of life, wash me with your blood, write my name in the book of life and command victory in all areas of my life. Thank You for answering my prayers and Your peace shall continue to reign in me, In Jesus name. Amen. </p>
<p>I have to congratulate you on that decision and I pray that the victory you have received shall be permanent in your life in Jesus name. Amen. I’m trusting God through the Holy Spirit that, He shall guide us for more instructions, and more revelations for you in Jesus name. Amen.
