								<h3><center>THE PATTERN (1)</center><hr></h3>
								<p>I believe there are some deep revelation the Holy Spirit want us to know about the issue of marriage (pattern). The marriage of concern is not just the physical or earthly marriage but that which is also spiritual (communion), for this is the pattern of God even our marriage with Jesus. Remember that the gospel and life is likened to a marriage.</p>
								<p> <strong> <em>NB: Whenever God give us a marriage picture, talks about a partnership or the issue of marriage, never make the mistake of not knowing through wisdom, understanding and prayer (Holy Spirit), the pattern designed to be followed or pursued. God expresses all things in patterns. Every (communion, relationship) marriage is designed with a pattern.</em> </strong> </p>
								<p>Let us examine some scriptures for our understanding. When God made man as referenced in Genesis chapters one and two, His intention is to commune daily with man and teach him what to do, say and the way to act or behave on earth. It is the desire of Trinity to replicate Himself in man, that’s why He made man in His image after His likeness. This is a pattern followed all through the scriptures where God looked for men He could replicate Himself in them, that the life of man brings God’s nature to the earth. Thus, making the earth a better place to the disgrace of the devil who thinks He can rule the earth without God and His approval,<strong> <em> who (God) is the pattern.</em> </strong> God is the pattern and without the pattern, failure is guaranteed. The pattern has never changed. </p>
								<p><strong> <em>Note: Anytime man thinks he can live without God, he has the mind-set of the devil.</strong> </em></p>
								<p> <strong>What is pattern? </strong> </p>
								<p>Pattern is the way something is made to operate/behave or is expected to function or what an entity responds to, that makes something uniquely the same or different from other thing(s). The pattern of concern in this article is God’s pattern. Take for example the remission of sin before God is through the shedding of blood. This is confirmed by Hebrews 9:22-28. </p>
								<p>According to God’s order there are two categories of pattern (general pattern and specific pattern).<strong> <em> The general pattern</strong> </em> is that, He spoke all things been created to form through His word (Jesus). Do you know that as a child of God you have the privilege in Christ Jesus being the word of God (John 1:1-4) to speak things to life in accordance with God’s will? <strong> <em>The specific pattern </strong> </em> is that He made all that He created in different kinds. Fishes of different kind were to live in the waters after their kinds, plants are to exist by finding root in the soil to produce fruits, food, some flowers and some just to respire. Also man is created after, to look like God (God’s image), Genesis 1:21-28.</p>
								<p><strong> <em>NB: It is a pattern through which a thing is made that brings relevance to that thing.</strong> </em></p>
								<p>When God wants to commune and tarry with Israel, He gave Moses for the construction of the tabernacle, a pattern to trap His presence for man’s advantage to walk with Him, and still God has not change. For because the desire of God is that, man walks perfectly with Him, He gave us Himself in the personality of Jesus to show us<strong> <em> the way, the pattern </strong> </em>to completely please Him by the help of the Holy Spirit. God will never be committed with you without showing you His pattern of operation in the dimension you seek to know Him.</p>
								<p>Part of the general pattern of God for making man is for man to exhibit Him and to be blessed by God, in terms of fruitfulness, multiplication, replenishing, subduing the earth and having dominion over all that God has made. Physically, man looks like he is walking in that direction but the truth is that, it is corrupted because it is not actually according to the pattern because man is trying to exclude God from the pattern, forgetting that <strong> <em> God is actually the pattern for man’s existence.</strong> </em> This is the reason for the lot of fear, complications and corruptions with many societies in the world based on our selfish desires to create things for ourselves to enslave others and gain money and superiority because we forget that we are created after the likeness of God.</p>
<p>The specific pattern of God for making man is that man should exhibit Him in his life which is perfectly expressed in the life of Jesus Christ. For before Jesus who is now a pattern for our existence; man in totality has failed to please God according to His standard. He has just only been merciful.
<br>In the dispensation of creation the pattern is that, God had free access to commune with man daily but after the fall due to disobedience, the pattern was that God withdraw His free access giving man freedom to choose to demand for it. Looking for man that will seek and trust Him.
</p>
<p><strong> <em>NB: God communes with everyman at their level of seeking to know Him</strong> </em></p>
<p>In my little study, I discovered that God has a pattern for earthly marriage which is<strong> <em> a man and a wife (woman);</strong> </em> not one man and two or more wives, not man and man, not woman and woman etc. Do you know? God stopped looking for man to walk with from the genealogy of Cain in Genesis 4:17-24, because a man Lamech took two wives for himself in verse 19 which is contrary to the pattern of God and that was the end to the recognition of that descendant as Heaven is concerned because it was evident in Genesis 5 when the bible shows us the genealogy of Adam starting with Seth and not Abel or Cain. </p>
<p>Also I discovered that what really caused the fall of man was that man did not well understood the pattern of God for creation. When God created man and woman. His intention is that man and woman become one, as husband and wife and help each other accomplish the purpose of their creation. But I discovered that though when God brought woman to man, and man declared it in Genesis 2:23 (“And Adam said, this is now bone of my bones, and flesh of flesh: she shall be called woman, because she was taken out of man”), the picture man had was; he has someone that looks like him in a new form from him. Also he had issues understanding and accepting God’s pattern for creating the woman which is to become man’s wife. That’s why Adam did not carry along his wife, who was supposed to help him achieve his purpose of creation daily. This allowed the devil to sneak in with lies that brought deception. The man and woman also did not understood what it meant by the saying in Genesis 2:24 (“…. And they shall be one flesh”) which actually means that; they needs to discuss and agree to take decisions as one not two. You know if the woman understood and actually related the lie of the devil to the man, and both man and woman relate the lie to God before taking any action to eat the fruit, man would not have fallen, because that is God’s pattern of communion.</p>
<p>I also discovered that man did not understood the pattern until after God came in the cool of the day to commune and discovered that man disobeyed Him. All God did, opened up man to the reality of His pattern and it was thereafter Adam named woman Eve. It was still from there that Adam commune with Eve for the first time. So understanding God’s pattern is important to man’s existence, if man will fulfil purpose.</p>
<p>The world is full of lust and corruption today because we have embraced the pattern of our desires (fame, wealth, money, status, superiority, power etc.) and ignored God’s pattern for our existence.</p>
<p>We need to understand God’s pattern per time or season. For before Jesus came, the pattern of God was embedded in the law through prophets, priests and even kings, where God looks unto one for the sake of men, country or tribe, to commune with them. But after that Jesus came for the redemption of man, God’s pattern is now embedded in the Grace (Jesus) through the Holy Spirit. Everyman can now commune with God easily through the help of the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p>So I beseech us this day brethren by the love and faith of God revealed to us in Christ Jesus to seek and walk in the pattern of God’s design for our existence and it is only the Holy Spirit that can reveal it to us. Remember John 16:12-13 and John14:16-18 & 26.
<br> <br>For more truth on the pattern of God, we can also read the following scriptures; Exodus 25:9 & 40, 1Chronicles 28:11-19, Ezekiel 43:10, 1Timothy 1:16, Hebrews 8:5. I’m trusting the Holy Spirit to open us up to know more of Him in Jesus name. Amen. </p>
