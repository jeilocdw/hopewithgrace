								<h3><center>ARM OF GOD: A great tool for man’s deliverance</center><hr></h3>
								<p>Arm is an essential part of a man’s body which is denoted for performing special functions. An open arm is known to mean good reception therefore we can say it symbolizes love (embrace). When a man’s arm is stretched out, it is either to embrace, comfort and welcome or to reject, fight against something.</p>
								<p>Arm of God: - This is a great tool for man’s deliverance, as it is stretched out always to deliver man from his oppression (bondage). Man has been in bondage of sin (evil) right from the Garden of Eden through the sin of Adam and Eve. Even though we are not qualified for God’s love yet He stretched forth His arms unto us for salvation, deliverance, sustenance and life. God desired to have man back to Himself so that we can have back the nature, heart of Him and get connected back to His Spirit. John 3:16 says “For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in Him should not perish, but have everlasting life.</p>
								<p><strong>What are the things man needs to be delivered from?</strong><hr>1.	Sin – This is the greatest tragedy of man’s existence. It enters man’s life and generations as a result of disobedience to God’s words. For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God. (Romans 3:23)
<br>2.	Satan – satan is an unrelenting enemy and he was the one who mislead man to come out of God’s presence in the Garden of Eden. This was because he wanted to have a solid ground to afflict man with death as a result of evil to lay siege upon man’s soul. satan knows; as long as man lives in sin, he has power (control) over man. NB – This is because satan is the father of all sinners (John 8:44)
<br>3.	Arm of flesh (man’s pride or ego) – When man is placed in the position of power, there is a pride that flows in him and if care is not taking, he/she will abuse that power, using it unnecessarily and this most times means oppression to other people. Examples are; pharaoh, king of Egypt in Exodus 5:2-5, also sennacherib, king of Assyria in 2 chronicles 32:8-15
<br>4.	Culture – In John 4:9, the woman of Samaria said unto Jesus that; “how is it that thou, being a Jew, asketh drink of me a woman of Samaria? For the Jew have no dealings with the Samaritans.
<br>5.	Sickness/Disease – In John 4:46-47, the son of a certain nobleman was sick to the point of death and had to come to Jesus for deliverance. So also in John 5:5, a certain man who was at a pool called Bethesda had an infirmity (disease) for 38years and Jesus had to deliver him. There are countless of other examples in the bible which Jesus shew unto us.
<br>6.	Poverty – It is poverty for a man to put all his strength in what he knows how to do best or what he has been trained to do and still have nothing to show for it after series of trying. In Luke 5:5, Simon Peter answered Jesus and said unto him, Master, we have tolled all the night and have taken nothing. This implies that it is possible for a man to work so hard and still have nothing to show for it.
<br>7.	Death – Man was not originally created by God to die. But when man ate of the fruit of the forbidden tree, death entered into the lineage of man (Genesis 3:1-6). Remember Romans 5:12; “Wherefore, as by one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin; and so death passed upon all men, for that all have sinned
 </p>
 <p><strong>The arm of God means salvation which serves as a tool for man’s deliverance:</strong> Jesus Christ has been given unto man by our Father in Heaven who loved us so much, and stretched His arm of mercy towards man. All he desires from us is to surrender our lives to Jesus completely and continue to trust and believe in Him. Then only can we enjoy in fullness all the functions of God’s arm as a tool for man’s deliverance. Remember Revelation 3:20; “Behold, I stand at the door, and knock; if any man hear my voice, and open the door, I will come in to him and will sup with him and he with Me”.</p>
<p><strong>God’s arm delivers man from the following;</strong> <br> <br>
1.	Sin – From 1Peter 2:21-24, Jesus Christ has delivered us from our sins and has bared it in His body on the cross that we being dead to sins should live unto righteousness.<strong> It is impossible for a man that have Jesus in his/her life, who is following Him correctly not to live right.</strong>
<br> <br>2.	Satan – Jesus has delivered us from satan and his tricks by showing us practically how to defeat him (In Mathew 4:1-11). This bible verses reveals to us some critical tools satan uses against man, over and over again. These are;
<br>i.	Food – the desire to eat
<br>ii.	Pride or Ego – wanting to boast of the privilege one enjoy by showing off what God has placed in us or our care
<br>iii.	Serving other gods apart from God alone who hath made us (i.e allowing not only God and His words to decide one’s faith)
<br>Jesus was victorious over satan by not allowing all these; showing unto us that we can also be victorious over satan. We can summarize the victory of Jesus over satan based on one attribute – obedience to God’s words alone. Remember satan used these three things against Eve and eventually Adam in the garden of Eden (Genesis 3:1-6)
<br><br> <strong>NB: Nothing else matters importantly in life except the word of God (Jesus)</strong>
<br><br>3.	Arm of flesh (man’s pride or ego) – Deuteronomy 4:34, 5:15, 7:19, John 8:3-11 and Isaiah 52:10. All these bible verses testify that the arm of the Lord delivers from the arm of flesh
<br><br>4.	Culture – In John 4:7-9, 4:40-42; Jesus delivered the Samaritans from the cultural code of conduct of the Jews. Which I can deduce from the verse 9 that “Jews thou shall not have anything to do with the Samaritans”. In verse 40, It was so clear that many Samaritans have started dealing with a Jews.
<br><br>5.	Sickness/Disease – John 4:50, John 5:8
<br><br>6.	Poverty – Luke 5:4-7
<br><br>7.	Condemnation – John 8:3-11
<br><br>8.	Death – Romans 5:21
<br><br>I’m trusting God that the Holy Spirit would lead us more on this and show us more of what He wants us to know.
</p>
<p><strong>Prayer</strong><hr>
-	Arm of God, enter into my life and deliver every aspect of it that needs deliverance in Jesus name.
<br>-	O’ Lord, empower me to always be obedient to your word alone through the help of the Holy Spirit
<br>-	Thank You Lord, for You always answer  prayers
<br>Once again I want to say thanks for sharing your time with us on this article. Do enjoy a life filled with Grace to be free from sin. Remember God’s presence + man’s race = Grace.
