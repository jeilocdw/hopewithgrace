								<h3><center>THE GREAT DESIRE</center><hr></h3>
								<p><strong>Main Text: Luke 19:4:- And he ran before, and climbed up into a sycomore tree to see him:
									 for he was to pass that way. (KJV)</strong></p>
									 <p> <strong>What is Desire?</strong>
									 Simply, Desire is what a man wants, to which he/she is willing to go to any extent to get or even abandon the things already possessed for its acquaintance. God so much desire to dwell in man and to give man power, for us to live a victorious life. This was possible through sacrificing His only begotten son Jesus, for all of Humanity. So we can also say, Desire is what we love.</p>
								<p>Due to revelation we would be considering today only one personality and that is Brother Zacchaeus. From Luke 19 verse 2 and 3 we obtain the following attribute or should we say characteristics of this Brother:
<br>					<strong>Brother Zacchaeus:
	<br>
1.	Stature – Little
<br>2.	Community status – Chief
<br>3.	Wealth status – Rich
<br>4.	 Identity – A publican (a sinner)
</strong>
								</p>
								<p>Despite all that Zacchaeus had (he had money, being a chief gave him influence), he knew those things was not enough to have a good life. Only God and the privilege to be with Him in Heaven, is the only quality measure, for a good life.</p>
								<p>So he sought to see Jesus, to know him, desired to be with Him and even if possible want Him to come to his house. All these efforts was because he knew, Jesus was not a respecter of man that He can be lured with riches or community status. So Brother Zacchaeus ran and ran, ahead of any other man, just because he so much desire to see Jesus that day or nothing else matters (that’s what we can call a great desire). Even when he thought of any other thing that can hinder him from seeing Jesus, which was his height, the main text made us to realize that he climbed a tree.</p>
								<p><strong>Now let me ask myself this questions:
<br>1.	To what extent am I willing to go, just to truly see Jesus? Because I desire to know, see, speak and be with him.
<br>2.	What are the things that can hinder me from truly seeing him?
<br>3.	What do I need to do, to see Him myself? Without any man (Whether fake or true) describing him to me.
</strong><br> <br>For our Brother, those questions were the main drive that eventually got him saved and his household that day.	</p>
<p>The most surprising thing was that there were many people following Jesus that day (just like the present day church) but there was none that Heaven bare witness in the Bible; that Jesus went home with, except Bro. Zacchaeus. This happen not because Zacchaeus called to Jesus but because Jesus being God in form of man knew his thoughts; that on getting to the place, He could not but just look up, saw him, call his name and told him to make haste and come down; for today, He (Jesus) <strong> <em>‘must’</em></strong> abide at Bro. Zacchaeus house (19vs5).</p>
<p>From verse 7: <strong> <em>and when they saw it, they all murmured, saying, that he was gone to be guest with a man that is a sinner.</em> </strong>
	It is confirmed from this verse, that there were multitude present on that occasion
	but only Zacchaeus was qualified for Jesus to dwell with. Why is this? It is because
	 of the ‘great desire’ Bro. Zacchaeus had. This reflect in his speech to Jesus when He abide with him
	  in verse 8.</p>
		<p> This you must know: Both <strong> <em>‘salvation and bondage’</em> </strong> are <strong> <em>products</em> </strong> of a <strong> <em>man’s desire</em> </strong> </p>
		<p>Jesus knowing the thoughts of our brother as recorded in verse 8, made him to realize, that salvation is not by our righteousness, but by the Grace received through our desire to know Him; who has made us and as attached us to His covenant which He made with us, Being a partaker of the <strong> Heavenly seed.</strong> So Zacchaeus and his house was saved that day.</p>
<p>Are you living a life not worthy of Heaven, and you know deep down within you that your life is a mess, or you’re thinking of running after prophets, herbalists e.t.c or your own desire is to get a good wife/husband, job, house, Car, Money e.t.c.</p>
<p> <strong>Believe me, those things will come and go, as long as Jesus is not in your life, not to talk of His word dwelling in you.</strong> </p>
<p>Are people mocking you as a sinner? Don’t worry, for today salvation is come to you. All you need is to desire with all of your heart, that Jesus come into your house (life), for Him only, has the power to save you from all that you’re struggling with. Just call unto him right there, as we pray together;</p>
<p> <strong>Prayer point: It is written that; For as he thinketh in his heart, so is he. (Prov. 23:7)</strong><hr>
<br>1.	Lord Jesus, help me to desire you with all my heart
<br>2.	Lord Jesus, help me to truly see and know you
<br>3.	Lord Jesus, let me be truly saved
<br>4.	Lord Jesus, baptize me with your Holy Spirit and Fire
<br>5.	Lord Jesus, write my name in Heaven (Book of Life)
<br>6.	Lord Help me to be a Your witness unto people
<br>7.	Thank You Lord for saving me and for answering my prayers
<br>In Jesus name we have prayed. Amen.</p>
