								<h3><center>THE CONSEQUENCE OF A NEGATIVE ACTION</center><hr></h3>
							<p>I thank Jesus who gave me the grace through the Holy Spirit to write this articles. I pray that our eyes shall be opened to walk in accuracy of positive actions that brings positive consequences (rewards), in Jesus name. Amen.</p>
							<p>I believe you will agree with me that; there is an end product for every action. For every action man takes, there is always a consequence (reward) for each of them, either positive or negative. Thus, there are two type of actions; positive actions and negative actions. Today we are considering negative actions as the Holy Spirit has prompted me to share this revelation gotten few months ago into the form an article. Follow me as the Holy Spirit leads us to the revelation of the truth He wants us to understand.</p>
							<p>This day we will be considering negative actions and two personalities in the bible are the subject for this article. First is Michal the wife of David, King Saul’s daughter. Second is Elimelech, Naomi’s husband. I will be brief with the article today.</p>
							<p><strong> 1.	The life of Michal David’s wife, Saul’s daughter </strong>
Michal was a lady that enjoyed great privilege being a king’s daughter, she never taught it wise to understand God but depend on his father’s position. A lot of negative actions were made for her and ultimately by her. Although she made a few right positive actions by letting down David through the window when King Saul sought for the life of David her husband. She made an ultimate mistake by despising the act of David worshipping God in front of the congregation of Israel and his servants.
</p>
<p> <strong>NB: Your negative ancestry has limited impacts on one until one begins to take negative actions. </strong> </p>
<p>Follow me please as we examine some scriptures; <br> <br>
<em>2 Sam 6:16-23
<br>16 And as the ark of the LORD came into the city of David, Michal Saul's daughter looked through a window, and saw king David leaping and dancing before the LORD; and she despised him in her heart.
<br>17 And they brought in the ark of the LORD, and set it in his place, in the midst of the tabernacle that David had pitched for it: and David offered burnt offerings and peace offerings before the LORD.
<br>18 And as soon as David had made an end of offering burnt offerings and peace offerings, he blessed the people in the name of the LORD of hosts.
<br>19 And he dealt among all the people, even among the whole multitude of Israel, as well to the women as men, to every one a cake of bread, and a good piece of flesh, and a flagon of wine. So all the people departed every one to his house.
<br>20 Then David returned to bless his household. And Michal the daughter of Saul came out to meet David, and said, How glorious was the king of Israel to day, who uncovered himself to day in the eyes of the handmaids of his servants, as one of the vain fellows shamelessly uncovereth himself!
<br>21 And David said unto Michal, It was before the LORD, which chose me before thy father, and before all his house, to appoint me ruler over the people of the LORD, over Israel: therefore will I play before the LORD.
<br>22 And I will yet be more vile than thus, and will be base in mine own sight: and of the maidservants which thou hast spoken of, of them shall I be had in honour.
<br>23 Therefore Michal the daughter of Saul had no child unto the day of her death.
											(KJV) </em> <br> <br> From the scriptures above, verse 23 made it clear that Michal had no child unto the day of her death. That is her consequence of negative action(s). What is the negative action she committed that warrant such consequence? The action was revealed in verse 16; she despised David in her heart because he was dancing and leaping before the Lord in his worship.
</p>
<p> <strong>NB: Whenever you despise the act of a genuine worship to the Lord by a true worshipper, you have also despise the Lord. </strong> </p>
<p>In time past I have heard preachers including myself, preached about Michal been the only woman in the Bible that remained barren all her life because of the action identified above. But few months ago the Holy Spirit corrected me. Do you know Michal was not barren? In fact she gave birth to 5 sons as confirmed by the Holy Spirit in the Scriptures but it is written of her that; <strong> she had no child unto the day of her death,</strong> not that she was barren.  Let us examine some truth of God’s words;</p>
<p> <em>2 Sam 21:1-9
<br>1 Then there was a famine in the days of David three years, year after year; and David inquired of the LORD. And the LORD answered, It is for Saul, and for his bloody house, because he slew the Gibeonites.
<br>2 And the king called the Gibeonites, and said unto them; (now the Gibeonites were not of the children of Israel, but of the remnant of the Amorites; and the children of Israel had sworn unto them: and Saul sought to slay them in his zeal to the children of Israel and Judah.)
<br>3 Wherefore David said unto the Gibeonites, What shall I do for you? and wherewith shall I make the atonement, that ye may bless the inheritance of the LORD?
<br>4 And the Gibeonites said unto him, We will have no silver nor gold of Saul, nor of his house; neither for us shalt thou kill any man in Israel. And he said, What ye shall say, that will I do for you.
<br>5 And they answered the king, The man that consumed us, and that devised against us that we should be destroyed from remaining in any of the coasts of Israel,
<br>6 Let seven men of his sons be delivered unto us, and we will hang them up unto the LORD in Gibeah of Saul, whom the LORD did choose. And the king said, I will give them.
<br>7 But the king spared Mephibosheth, the son of Jonathan the son of Saul, because of the LORD's oath that was between them, between David and Jonathan the son of Saul.
<br>8 But the king took the two sons of Rizpah the daughter of Aiah, whom she bare unto Saul, Armoni and Mephibosheth; and the five sons of Michal the daughter of Saul, whom she brought up for Adriel the son of Barzillai the Meholathite:
<br>9 And he delivered them into the hands of the Gibeonites, and they hanged them in the hill before the LORD: and they fell all seven together, and were put to death in the days of harvest, in the first days, in the beginning of barley harvest.
								(KJV) </em>
</p>
<p>From verse 1 above, I discover another terrible action of king Saul which caused a famine in the days of David. But David detect the strange move and sought the Lord. David received instruction to render 7 sons of Saul as the remedy for Saul’s actions that brought the famine. </p>
<p><strong>NB: You must have the ability to discerned negative consequences that is not in alignment with God’s covenant for you </strong> </p>
<p> <strong>NB: Most negative actions have generational consequences. Never take a negative action.</strong> </p>
<p>It is from verse 8 that I discovered from the selection of David that Michal was not barren and she only didn’t just had any child unto the day of her death (all her children, five sons died) to confirm what was spoken of her.  Her negative action allowed her ancestry (Saul’s sin) to catch up with her.</p>
<p> <strong>NB: Choose positive actions that will not allow any negative ancestry to have legal ground to function in your life.  </strong> </p>
<p> <strong>2.	Elimelech Naomi’s husband</strong> <br> <br>
Elimelech is a man that has a passion for his family, he also want to make sure there is abundance for his wife and children, never wanted them to suffer. I deduced this from the scriptures I will share later, based on the question; what could make a father to take his wife and children from their land to sojourn in another land because of famine? Love for his family. But instead of seeking the lord just like David did when there is a famine as seen in 2 Sam 21:1 shared before, Elimelech resolved to his discretion and knowledge to look for greener pasture. This is the same way most people in this generation are living. I have seen over the years when I asked some youths in Nigeria what they want? They said they want to travel abroad for greener pastures. This action has got many into trouble in sorting that out. </p>
<p> <strong>NB: Never leave a place of covenant and destiny because of physical circumstances and knowledge.</strong> </p>
<p>Back to the scriptures; <em>
Ruth 1:1-6
<br>1 Now it came to pass in the days when the judges ruled, that there was a famine in the land. And a certain man of Bethlehem Judah went to sojourn in the country of Moab, he, and his wife, and his two sons.
<br>2 And the name of the man was Elimelech, and the name of his wife Naomi, and the name of his two sons Mahlon and Chilion, Ephrathites of Bethlehem Judah. And they came into the country of Moab, and continued there.
<br>3 And Elimelech Naomi's husband died; and she was left, and her two sons.
<br>4 And they took them wives of the women of Moab; the name of the one was Orpah, and the name of the other Ruth: and they dwelled there about ten years.
<br>5 And Mahlon and Chilion died also both of them; and the woman was left of her two sons and her husband.
<br>6 Then she arose with her daughters in law, that she might return from the country of Moab: for she had heard in the country of Moab how that the LORD had visited his people in giving them bread.
										(KJV) </em>
</p>
<p>From verse 1 above, it was discovered that Elimelech took the journey to leave the place (a land filled with milk and honey) God has covenanted with his generation because of famine. He forgot that when there is famine in the place of covenant it is due to man’s shortcomings and it is of a spiritual move which need a spiritual discernment to overturn such evil. So Elimelech resulted into an action that destroyed him with a generational consequence because it affected his two sons as well, they also died as revealed between verses 3 to 5. And to what end is this action, verse 6 confirmed that while Elimelech left, God visited His people.</p>
<p> <strong> NB: we are the people of God (Psalms 24) </strong> <br> <br>
What are you going through today that has captured your attention so much that you are forgetting you belong to God? Never made that mistake of a negative action of thinking you can solve any of all your troubles alone without the divine.
<br> <br> <strong>NB: The only ultimate negative actions you can engage in today is to reject or deny Jesus. Jesus is the only way to God (John 14:6).</strong>
 </p>
 <p>I want us to examine our actions, reflect on the choices and decisions we have made and will be making in our life. It is never too late to birth forth a positive tomorrow through positive actions that brings positive consequences. Many of us are reaping the consequences of our father’s negative actions today, but that can change by our own positive actions to truly seek God with all our hearts. The first step to this, is by embracing God (Jesus) and I assure you positive consequences is surely come as you grow in Him.</p>
 <p>If you want to take that decision we me now, you can declare the following words;
“Thank you God for the privilege you gave me through Jesus. I confess today by the declaration of my mouth that I accept Jesus as my Lord and Saviour, I believe He died and resurrected for my sake for life. Come into my Life and live in me through Your Holy Spirit. This day I reject devil’s lies and embrace You the truth of God in Jesus. Amen”.
</p>
<p>If you took that decision with me, I want to congratulate you as heaven is rejoicing over you and I assure you, this is a decision any man can regret. God be with you richly in Jesus name. </p>
<p>I want to say thank you, for sharing part your time with us on this article. Do enjoy a life filled with Grace to be free from sin. Remember always, <strong> God’s presence + man’s race = Grace. </strong>
	<br>
Remain blessed.
