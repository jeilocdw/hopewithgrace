								<h3><center>PRESERVATION OF GOD</center><hr></h3>
								<p>No matter how dangerous a man’s environment, job, family, friends are or how strong, resourceful, wise his enemy could be, if the Lord preserve a man, family, finances, life, relationship e.t.c, the man will always overcome every challenge he/she faces, be it the one prepared for or the ones unprepared for. I want us to look at an example from the scripture in the book of first Chronicles 18:1-6. It is written that David prepared to take Zobah unto Hamath as he has done unto the Philistines and Moabites earlier, in order to establish his dominion by the river Euphrates. Little did he know that a stronger force lies ahead to help Hadarezer king of Zobah, I mean about twenty two thousands Syrians not to talk of the warriors and people of Zobah that died with their king that day. David went with only twenty eight thousand people. And verse 6 made it clear that all the victories David had was because God preserved him whithersoever he went.</p>
									<p><strong>What is preservation?</strong> Preservation is a deliberate act of keeping something valuable safe from decay or spoilage. It is known that you can only preserve what you know and have with you. Permit me to site an example; if you want to preserve tomatoes, first you have to go to the market and buy it. On getting to the seller at the market, you have to price and then pay for it before you can be allowed to take it home for preservation. Please note that the selling is at the seller’s choice because he/she may deliberately not want to sell to some category of people or even accept/reject the price. Likewise for God to preserve man he needs to know and have us to himself. Examine this:<br>
							<strong>
										God = Buyer        		              <br>   Price = Jesus		<br>	Market = Earth
    <br> Seller = our existence on earth (our body) 	 <br>   Tomatoes = our soul and spirit</strong>
									<p>
								<p>We’re valuable to God and He didn’t want us to be a waste, that’s why Jesus came from heaven to pay the price for me and you. So that God can know, have and preserve us, that’s why Jesus always emphasize that he didn’t come to do His own will but the will of His Father. God is the buyer my brethren for us to have the privilege to dwell where He is, in His kingdom (Heaven). He sent His Son to die for us. Many us today claim to know God but have not allowed ourselves to be completely bought and broken by the price of Jesus on the cross. This goes beyond just going to church or calling ourselves Christians.
								</p>
								<p>There are six things that will happen when God preserves a man: The man will always be an overcomer, the man will be safe, the man’s enemies will lose their freedom, the man will have dominion, the man will be congratulated by respected and honourable people and lastly, the man will never fail God. I pray God will preserve us in Jesus name, AMEN. The truth is He cannot preserve you if you’ve not accepted the great price Jesus paid for all. The Good news is that, you can do that now just say this words:<br><br><em>
									<strong>“Lord Jesus I thank you for the privilege given to me by you paying the price for my preservation, forgive all my sins through your mercy and truth, come into my life, write my name in the book of life and preserve me, be my Saviour and Lord, in Jesus name I pray. Amen”.
								</strong></em>
								<br><br>If you took that step with me, I’m using this opportunity to congratulate you. I pray God will continue to bless you. Thank you for your time.
