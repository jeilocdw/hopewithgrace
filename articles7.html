								<h3><center>LUST: The source of all the corruptions in this world</center><hr></h3>
								<p> <strong>Main Text: 2Peter 1:4; whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises: that by these ye might be partakers of the divine nature, having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust. (KJV) </strong>
									</p>
									<p><strong>What is corruption?</strong>
Corruption is doing what is not right i.e what we cannot find in the word of God but in existence. In another form we can say it is, what is not supposed to be found somewhere but actually found which is against the divine natural existence mandate or laws and regulations.
</p>
<p>From the main text Corruption in this world is through lust and one cannot lust without seeing with the physical eyes and translating with human wisdom, what one can gain from it which in all cases eventually result to nothing but more stress to further exploit irrelevant things with necessity. Corruption is as a result of following the direction of what we see which is contrary to what is right and true. It is only the word of God that is always right and true.</p>
<p>In Genesis 3:4-5, it is an ethic of the devil (Satan) to use lust to lure man to see things, which are irrelevant to man growth in God’s presence. Satan’s main aim is to distract man from wanting to always dwell in Gods’ presence because he knew that God’s presence in man’s life means total victory (always). So satan always looks for means to make man see things as if we can measure up to becoming god ourselves without needing God, neglecting the fact that we cannot truly survive on our own in this world without God. We should remember that since when man lost God’s presence in the Garden of Eden until the time Jesus Christ came to this world, the life of man was never balanced. Jesus came to give all man what he/she has lost from the time of Adam and Eve.</p>
<p> <strong>NB: “God’s presence makes man to see with his spiritual eyes while satan makes man to see with his physical eyes”</strong> <br> <br>In that Genesis 3:5, satan made man to see that he doesn’t need God to be like God and in verse 6; man <strong>saw</strong> (lust). From this action, corruption entered the world of man. </p>
<p><strong> NB: satan cannot force a man to do anything until he/she yields to seeing the option he gives, which looks beautiful, fast and stress free. This is always contrary to God’s word. That’s why on judgment day, man will be responsible for all his actions, reactions and activities whether deceived or not. A similar case is stated in Genesis 3:11-19 (Remember always that God’s word is perfect and complete).</strong></p>
					<p>One of the greatest goodness/tragedy of man’s nature is that when we see things we always tend to share with others. Man is a social being and will naturally extend his downfall or greatness to others (its man’s nature). The question is; what do I and you extend (share) to others?</p>
					<p>Let us treat more examples in the bible: Genesis 9:21-28; something prompted Ham the father of Canaan to see the nakedness of his father Noah (lust) and also he choose to implicate his two brethren but Shem and Japheth choose to do the right thing because there was spiritual sensitivity that even when they were presented physically with lust they still did what is right.</p>
					<p>Genesis 12:15-20; why would Pharaoh took Sarai into his house? Are there not beautiful woman in his palace or in Egypt? The fact is that lust made him unsatisfied with what he already had because satan used his princes to tell him to see, this nearly got him and his nation into trouble.</p>
					<p>Also in Genesis 13:10-11; Lot lusted after a well-watered area and choose for himself Sodom and Gomorrah, an area that nearly got him and his family destroyed. In short his wife was destroyed because she covet after the city they left behind by ignoring divine instruction and she became salt.</p>
					<p>Genesis 25:32; Esau saw no big deal in selling his birth right to his brother Jacob, even at the point of hunger because of what he would eat, he saw the delicious food. Also in Genesis 29:9-20; Jacob care less about God’s position for him concerning his marital issue unlike that of Isaac’s because he choose for himself what he saw. I meant the beauty of Rachel.</p>
					<p>Numbers 13:31-33; The spies Moses sent to spy the land apart from Caleb and Joshua saw not God and His word but saw giants which made them to bring evil report of the land to Moses and the children of Israel. They corrupted themselves because of this with disbelieve and dragged as many as possible with them, causing destruction to many lives as a result.</p>
					<p>1 Samuel 8:1-7; The elders of Israel want Samuel to give them king to judge Israel because of what they saw. They forgot that it was God in Samuel that judged Israel and not Samuel himself. So they lusted after what they saw all other nations doing because Samuel was aged and his children walk not aright. This is one of the problems we are experiencing today in churches. Many serves the people God is using and not wanting to see personally that God or experience Him themselves. It is so sad that many don’t even know the God they claim to be serving and eventually when they detect any fault with the leaders, pastor or man of God, they will castigate him, withdraw themselves from church, some will even lure people with tender faith to withdraw from the faith they claim with their words whereas we do not even understand the faith itself genuinely.</p>
					<p><strong>NB: The problem is not the man or men of God, the major problem is us”</strong></p>
					<p><strong>What do we seek, Man or God?</strong> <hr>
						1 Samuel 13:9-11; in verse 11 Saul saw that people were scattering from him just because he was been patient and trying to do the right thing by waiting for the Samuel (the ordained), so he decided to look in the direction of the multitude and ordained himself as a prophet by performing a sacrifice he was not ordained to do.
					 </p>
					 <p> <strong>NB: To us all that God as handed things in our care, never get carried away by the trends, attitudes, actions or reactions of people towards what is right and true (God’s word), just continue to trust God patiently through humility, perseverance, love, honesty, prayer and God’s word. I pray that the Grace to do God’s desires, God will grant unto us in Jesus name.</strong> </p>
					 <p>We can also read the following scriptures for more examples which I am trusting God through the Holy Spirit that our spiritual eyes will open to understand the truth he wants us to know. We can read Genesis 6:1-6.
<br>Also in Joshua 7:20-21, Achan saw among the spoils (good garment, silver and gold) from the war. Lust made him to corrupt Israel by bringing those items into their midst, this got the whole nation into trouble. In Judges 16:1-4, Samson corrupted himself by joining himself to a harlot and also Delilah because he saw (lust). We also know his ending.
</p>
<p> <strong>NB: The product of corruption that comes as result of lust is always devastating. Most times, there is no second chance. “So it is better not be corrupted than to be revived because “if” it is a genuine revival, it is like starting all over again and that is even “if” there is a privilege of a second chance.</strong> <br> <br> 2 Samuel 11:2-5; David saw and corrupted himself (lust). We know what it gave rise to. <br> <br> <strong>NB: It is not a crime to see because even with God we have to see but if what comes to our sight is not in accordance (i.e contrary) with God’s word (bible our Guide) then we should not follow the direction of what we see, as it is a temptation. It is better to pray under such circumstances.</strong> </p>
<p>2 Samuel 1:1-16; that young man wanted honour and praise for himself by wanting to please David due to what he saw that transpired, knowing Saul wanted David dead. This made him to lie not knowing he is only writing a letter to his own death. In Esther 3:5, Haman saw that Mordecai did not bow to him and lusted after pride because God allowed him to be promoted. We all know how he ended the destiny of his house.</p>
<p> <strong>NB: It is stupidity that will make a man to be envious of others, particularly at the foolish, when he/she sees the prosperity of the wicked from Psalms 73:3-22.
“What a man see is what he experience”, “man can only see what he seeks”. This implies we can only see evil when we seek it, and good when we seek it.
<br></strong>Ezekiel 23:4-22; Aholibah saw the ways of Aholah her sister and corrupted herself also. Her end was stated in verse 22 just like her sister’s ending.
 </p>

<p><strong>How to overcome lust</strong> <br>
I will also like to share some examples in the bible before discussing further the solution as it is relevant to know that people have been able to overcome lust before which I pray we shall also become overcomers in Jesus name. At this point, I want to make some references:
<br>-	Caleb and Joshua saw God in the midst of Israel and knew victory is assured even when they have not gone to war (God’s presence) Numbers 13:30 & Numbers 14:6-8
<br>-	Moses’s saw a bush burning with fire and not consumed, he could have ran away because that is contrary to human knowledge. He decided to take a look and his spiritual ears and eyes was opened to know what God wants him to do. If we were in Moses’s shoes, in this modern day, many would have impatiently run away shouting (“Emo wolu ooo”, Yoruba language meaning “Trouble has entered the society”).
</p>
<p> <strong>NB: No man born of a woman can actually do the work of God but it is God that chooses to do His work in every man’s life.</strong>
<br>-	John the Baptist saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove from Heaven upon Jesus when no other man can see this, because God has ordained him to come ahead off Jesus and also, he has God’s presence in his life. Mark 1:10
<br>-	Paul saw Jesus in the midst of a bright light shining upon him in the book of Acts that took him to a street called straight, because God desire to save his life
<br>-	Isaiah saw also the Lord in Isaiah 6:1
<br>-	 Stephen saw heavens opened when he was stoned to death
<br>The question I want to ask us is;
<br>What do me and you see? Or better put, What are you and me seeing today?
</p>
<p><strong>Back to 2 peter 1:4, We can escape lust and corruptions that is in this world via the following:</strong>
 <br>(1) Loving God with all our heart and life, Matthew 22:37
<br>(2) The exceeding great and precious promises given unto us by God through Jesus, so that we can be partaker of His great divine nature.
<br> <br>These promises are;
<br>1.	Salvation: We need to be genuinely saved (Truly born again) John 3:17
<br>2.	Eternal life: John 3:16, Matthew 25:46, Mark 10:30
<br>3.	Victory: 1 Corinthians 15:57, 1 John 5:4
<br>4.	Holy Spirit: John 14:16-18, Luke 11:13
<br>5.	Grace of evangelism and deliverance: Matthew 10:13, John 15:16
<br>6.	Love: Matthew 5: 43-48, Mark 12:33, Luke 6:27, John 13:34-35
<br>7.	Peace: John 14:27, John 16:33, Mark 5:34, Luke 1:79, Luke 7:50, Luke 8:48
<br>8.	Divine provision: Luke 5:1-9, John 6:5-14
<br> <br>And many more, just allow the Holy Spirit to lead you as you meditate.
</p>
<p> <strong>Some prayer points: For it is written that whatsoever we shall ask in the name of Jesus shall be granted unto us, therefore;</strong>
<hr> 1.	God’s presence is key:  My life, receive the abundance of God’s presence in the name of Jesus
<br>2.	My life (body, soul and spirit), receive the fullness of the Holy Spirit in Jesus name
<br>3.	My life, receive  the power and grace to sustain God’s presence to the end through the fullness of the fire of the Holy Spirit, so that I can finish this human race well (heaven)
<br>4.	My spiritual eyes be opened in the name of Jesus
<br>5.	Lord Jesus, save me from all forms of lust that may come my way in Jesus name
<br>6.	Lord Jesus, save Nigeria and the world at large from the corruptions that dwells in it for Your name sake
