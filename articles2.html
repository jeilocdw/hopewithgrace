								<h3><center>THE UNRELENTING ENEMY</center><hr></h3>
								<p>In accordance with the scriptures, the philistines are one of the greatest enemy of Israel
									they’re restless at going to war against Israel (God’s people), even when other enemies of Israel relax,
									they don’t. Likewise today as Born again and Children of God we have an unrelenting enemy who is always
									at war against us, satan by name otherwise known as the devil. Note: I’m not saying that man has only one enemy,
									 but of all the enemy of man, satan does not relax even when others do.</p>
									 <p>Permit me to share with you this, in the light of God’s word as it is written. Considering 1 chronicles 20:4-8.</p>
									 <p><strong><em>“Verse 4: And it came to pass after this, that there arose a war at Gezer with the Philistines; at which time
										 Sibbechai the Hushathite slew Sippai, that was of the children of the giant and they were subdued.<br>
										 5: And there was war again with the philistines; and Elhanan the son of Jair slew Lahmi the brother of Goliath the Gittite,
										  whose spear staff was like a weaver’s beam. <br>
											6: And yet again there was a war at Gath, where was a man of great stature, whose fingers and toes were four and twenty,
											six on each hand and six on each foot and he also was the son of the giant. <br>
											7: But when he defied Israel, Jonathan the son of Shimea David’s brother slew him. <br>
											8: These were born unto gaint in Gath,
											and they fell by the hand of David and by the hand of his servants”. </em></strong></p>
								<p>From the above verses, it is discovered that Israel has a stubborn enemy and a great one to be precise for before that time
									they have been coming to war against Israel. It is derived that they were subdued at first but they won’t just give up yet
									they lost the second time, instead of quitting they still came again the third time and fell. They fell not because they were
									 weak, because the verses made us to understand that they are giants which tells us that they are powerful enemy. So also
									 Christians (Israel of today) have three great enemies namely; <br><strong> 1. Self </strong><br><br>
<strong>2. Sin </strong>(even though many will say it is the world, yes that’s true but this you must know that the world itself in it’s own nature from the
beginning of creation is not an enemy until when man was subjected to the spirit of sin in the garden of Eden, so it is not the world that’s
the enemy but the powers that manipulates it against God) and <br><br>
<strong>3. The third is Satan </strong> which is the greatest of all the enemies (don’t be curious, I know you might have heard that self is the greatest
because it’s the closest to man but examine this; all other enemies of man either great or not are subjective to Satan because if allowed, he has power
to use them as devices even though they are enemies themselves).
</p>
<p>Since the time satan persuaded man to kill the spirit of God in man through disobedience that made man to unleash unto himself the spirit of sin
	in the garden of Eden, up till now satan has not stop working and he’s looking for means day by day to make sure man did not prevail. I pray that satan
	 will not prevail over us in Jesus name. Please let us examine some scriptures to ascertain this fact. In Mathew Chapter 4, it can be discovered that the
	  devil also known as satan even the tempter did not go alone to tempt Jesus but subject the two remaining great enemies to help him against Jesus; from
		verse 3, he subjected the spirit of self to Jesus but failed. Then stepped up to the spirit of sin in verses 5 and 6 to Jesus but failed again. Then he
		stirred up himself (devil) to Jesus in verses 8 and 9 and failed totally. So also in 1 chronicles 21:1, when satan saw that all the enemies he stirred up
		 against David did not prevailed in chapter 20 then he went to him personally to provoked (persuaded) him to number Israel even when God warned David through Joab.
		  Therefore remember that satan means business and we need to be at alert always. The word of God gave us an illustration of what to expect as long as we are on
			earth in Revelation 12:12. Note: All other enemies of man can function as satan’s device at any point in time and his aim is to persuade man against the counsel
			 of God’s word. I pray that every power that wants to corrupt our Israel shall fail and lose their existence over our lives in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen</p>
