								<h3><center>WINNING THE ISHMAELITES</center><hr></h3>
								<p><strong>
									Genesis 16:7-12, Genesis 17:15-21, Judges 8:24,
									Mathew 7:7-8,17-19, Mathew 5:16-17,37 and 48, Psalms 83:1-16, Mathew 22: 36-40,
									 Mark 12: 29-31, John 3:16, John 14:15.
								</strong></p>
								<p>
									As you are a witness of the present situation the world find herself, It is evident that part of the ways the devil is using against the covenanted (God's Children i.e me and you) is the increase breeding and sustenance of the Ishmaelites in terms of belief, character, attitude and faith.
<br><strong> Who's an Ishmaelite?</strong> Ishmaelite is any personality born into the lineage of Ishmael by blood, belief, faith, behaviour, attitude, or by his/her works.
<br><strong> Who's Ishmael? </strong> Ishmael is a personality as a result of circumstance that tend to claim the glory, position, authority, people or things which does not rightfully belong to him (a prototype not the actual thing).							</p>
								<p> <strong>
									Attributes of an Ishmaelite:</strong><hr>
1. They are wild man and their hand is against every other man. Gen. 16:12. <br>
2. They dwell among us freely and are a great nation but bear no everlasting covenant with God. Gen. 17:17-21
<br>3. Once you join yourself with them you will lose completely the everlasting covenant of God for your lineage like Esau did even though God blessed him but there was nothing like God of Abraham, Isaac and Esau in the Bible. Gen. 28:8-9
<br>4. They have, use and love possessions (material things like Gold, silver e.t.c.) that could cause problems for covenant children. Judges 8:24-27.
<br>5. They do not believe in Jesus or do not obey His commandments
								</p>
								<p> <strong>
									Why winning the Ishmaelite? </strong> <hr>
1. God loves all men. John 3:16.
<br>2. God and the host of heaven must be happy with the generation of man
<br>3. So that God's people can enjoy Godâ€™s peace, love and everlasting life even here on earth and life after. <br><br>
<strong>How to win the Ishmaelites?</strong><hr>
<strong>1. Genuine Salvation and sustenance:</strong> Before someone can win an Ishmaelite, you need the power, knowledge, wisdom. All these works under the command of the Holy Spirit which is the evidence of genuine salvation and the ability to sustain the salvation which makes your inner life perfect before God. John 3:16, 18, Romans 10:8-10 and John 8:36, Mathew 5:48.
<br><strong>2. The Great testimonies of God in our lives:</strong> Many are times we misconstrue this for wealth, fame, power, membership or possessions in general. To have peace surrounding you, your family and the ability to feed God's people around you with the truth always, are great testimonies to mention a few. Act 2:37-41.
<br><strong>3. Pray for the genuine Salvation of their soul and its sustenance</strong> Romans 1:9, Act 12:5, 2Tim. 1:3
<br><strong>4. Evangelism:</strong> Preach the gospel of Christ to them Mathew 11:28-30.
<br><br>
<strong>Now when they heard this, they were pricked in their heart and said to Peter and the rest of the apostles, Men and brethren, what shall we do?  Act 2:37.
 <br> <br>5. Obey the commandments of God in Grace (JESUS)</strong> Mathew 22:36-40 and Mark 12:29-31.
<br> <br> <strong>Brethren let us witness to the world to save them from destruction. Witness to the unsaved in your family (John 1:40-42), neighbourhood, place of work, town etc. Friends let us witness to the world, so that they can be a partaker of eternal counsel of God. Remember God loves the world to be saved and man is the tool. (We are the tool) </strong>
								</p>
								<p>
								<strong>	PRAYER POINT  </strong>
<hr> 1.	Lord help me to love sinners and witness to them powerfully.
<br>2.	Equip me o Lord for fruitful evangelism.
<br>3.	Lord, may you not have any reason to require the blood of anybody from me on judgement day.<br>
Thank you for your time and remain blessed.
