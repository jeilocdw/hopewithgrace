								<h3><center>THE QUESTIONS THAT WILL MAKE YOU GREAT.</center><hr></h3>
								<p>Please help me answer the questions that will be consistently asked below with patience.</p>
								<p><strong>Why do you hate JESUS?</strong><br>I know it may sound funny or somehow to you, probably you’re thinking in your heart that “I’m a Christian and I believed in Him so I do not hate Him or I’m a Muslim and I don’t have anything to do with Him” let us all examine ourselves, is the life we’re living truly worth it? Please be sincere and are we just being referred to as a person, Muslim, Christian or redeemed (saved or born again)? <br> Please note this is beyond religion. <em>“These are they which were not defiled with women, for they are virgins. These are they which follow the lamb whithersoever he goeth. These were redeemed among men, being the first-fruits unto God and to the lamb (Revelation 14:4).</em> I know it may be ringing in your mind that this does not concern me and perhaps I’m not a man or I’m still a virgin. JESUS said that; <em>“But those things which proceed out of the mouth come forth from the heart and they defile the man. For out of the heart proceed evil thoughts, murders, adulteries, fornications, thefts, false witness, and blasphemies” (Matthew 15:18-19).</em> </p>
								<p>You may now be thinking of how this now concerns you? it is written that <em>“Who shall ascend into the hill of the LORD? Or who shall stand in his holy place? He that hath clean hands and a pure heart; who hath not lifted up his soul unto vanity, nor sworn deceitfully” (Psalms 24:3-4).</em> Now permit me to ask you this.</p>
								<p><strong>Why did people hate JESUS?</strong><br> Some because of religion forgot that there are only two type of things in this world <strong>“either GOOD or EVIL”. </strong>This was unleashed unto man through deception of the serpent in the Garden of Eden. Some cannot even give a concrete reason why they hate JESUS but I’m putting it to you that we hate Him because He is good and always emphasize love, unity, truth, holiness, righteousness, the kingdom of GOD among all other good things and hated evil.<em>“Thou hath loved righteousness and hated iniquity; therefore GOD, even thy GOD, hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy fellows” (Hebrews 1:9). </em>JESUS came to the world to save man from sin and makes us dead to it, but because we love sin due to our flesh (self) we hate Him. Permit me to ask you this question. <strong>Do you hate sin?</strong> It is written that <em>“And this is condemnation, that light is come into this world, and man loved darkness rather than light, because their deeds were evil” (John 3:19).</em></p>
								<p><strong>Do you love JESUS now?</strong><br>JESUS said <em>“he that hath my commandments and keepeth them, he it is that loveth me and he that loveth me shall be loved of my father and I will love him, and will manifest myself to him” (John 14:21). </em> Are you keeping his commandments? Remember HEAVEN is real and so also is HELL. Nobody can see God and inherit His kingdom except through JESUS. <em>“if ye had known me, ye should have known my Father also: and from henceforth ye know him, and have seen him” (John 14:9). </em>Therefore if we do not love JESUS and keep his commandments then we will not inherit the kingdom of GOD. <em>“Now this I say, brethren that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of GOD; neither doth corruption inherit incorruption” (1 Corinthians 15:50, you can also read Galatians 5:20-21 and Ephesians 5:5 for more on that).</em></p>
								<p><strong>Do you want to inherit the kingdom of GOD?</strong><br> Remember life is a race, but to finish well and earn a prize is very important because nobody wants to be a loser. To achieve this we need Extra strength as a participant in this race of life. The extra strength we need is GOD, GOD with the race of our life is = GRACE which brings about a great end which is HEAVEN and not a bad end which is HELL. JESUS is the grace you need, to have an expected end (HEAVEN).<br> Please stop hating JESUS but love him, surrender your life to JESUS today so that you can also inherit HEAVEN, you can never tell what will happen in the next moment but JESUS can and tomorrow might never come. Don’t end your life in HELL.</p>
								<p>Thank you for sparing part of your time and remain blessed.</p>
