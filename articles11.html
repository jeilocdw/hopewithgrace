								<h3><center>THE VICTORY OF MAN</center><hr></h3>
								<p>I thank Jesus who gave me the grace through the Holy Spirit to write this articles. I pray that our eyes shall be opened to man’s victory in Christ, in Jesus name. Amen.
I believe you will agree with me that if there is no war, we won’t need to talk about or understand victory. When we are now focusing on man’s victory, it is then necessary to identify the war that man is fighting. The entity that man is fighting against, and the equipment of war that brings victory.
</p>
<p>The battle that the earth has experienced or is experiencing, is not between God and the devil or God and man. It is between man (man and woman) and the devil. I want us to examine some scriptures at this point to prove it. </p>
<p>After that man disobeyed God in the Garden of Eden through satan’s lies in Genesis 3:14-15;
<br><br>
<em>“14: – And the <strong>LORD God</strong> said unto the <strong>serpent,</strong> because thou hast done this, thou art <strong>cursed</strong> above all cattle, and above every beast of the field; upon thy belly shalt thou go, and <strong>dust</strong> shalt thou eat <strong>all the days of thy life.</strong>  15: – And<strong> I </strong>will put <strong>enmity</strong> between <strong>thee and the woman</strong>, and between <strong>thy seed</strong> and <strong>her seed;</strong> it shall <strong>bruise thy head</strong>, and thou shalt <strong>bruise his heel"</strong>.
</em>    <br><br>
From the verses above, we will discover, it was God Himself that spoke this war to life. It became a prophecy. So a question sprang up in me (Who shall win between man and serpent(satan)?). To further confuse the devil, God attached a solution, which is; when the serpent continues in his subtle way to bruise (lies) the heel of the woman’s seed, the seed of the woman shall bruise (truth) the head of the serpent. It is well known for snake killers that, once you bruise the head of a snake, the snake is defeated. </p>
<p> <strong> <em>NB: the devil does not understand prophesy</em> </strong> </p>
<p>This is how the battle is said to be by God’s curse; serpent from this day, you shall feed on (man) dust all the days of your life. That means; no man to prey on, no food for the devil. Remember Genesis 2:7 <em>(“And <strong> the LORD God formed man of the dust </strong> of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life and man became a living soul”).</em> </p>
<p>Let me ask us a question; Who does not cherish is daily food? Or who shall relax knowing fully well where the food is and go hungry without taking the food? This is the same for the serpent (devil - Rev. 12:9). This is the reason why the devil is working day and night to feed on man’s soul by all sort of media (fornication, masturbation, same sex perversions, hatred etc.) through lies and deception, making man his prey, hindering and blinding them from knowing their true identity and the victory God made provisions for in Christ Jesus (the woman’s seed), so that he can feed on them.</p>
<p>NB: Never become a prey or meal for the devil. Luke 10:18-19</p>
<p>The intention of God is that man have victory over satan and the only way provided by God is through the woman’s seed (Jesus).
Now let’s understand the woman’s seed. In the arena of life when it comes to talking about seed, we often relate to child and children. So woman’s seed is the child or fruit produced by the child of a woman. We can understand this from two dimension the <strong> birth of man </strong>and <strong>His fruits </strong>. The normal path for conceiving by every woman is through the man’s and the woman’s seed donated during their union. But Jesus was born only from the woman’s seed through the Holy Ghost that the scriptures affirm in Mt. 1:18-25 and Lk.1:34-35. So the reason why Jesus had to come in the way He came is because God’s has spoken of it and that’s is the only way for man’s victory. It is possible for God to bath victory for man with a snap of His finger but He didn’t do that but rather was faithful to His word by coming in the flesh as woman’s seed.
</p>
<p> <strong>NB: The word of God is potent and will always come to reality</strong></p>
<p>Jesus is the woman’s seed spoken of by birth, and also manifested as woman’s seed with respect to man’s fruit (the truth). Note this Jesus said that He is the way, <strong> the truth </strong> and the life in Jn 14:6. Why because He knew the only thing that could conquer the devil’s seed (lies) is the <strong>truth.</strong> </p>
<p>How many of us know that Jesus has bruised the head of devil for your sake? You shouldn’t continue in that life of lies, deception and sin again.  The devil bruised Jesus heel by condemning Him to the cross through the High priest and most Israelites as at then because of the devil’s lies, ego etc. Don’t allow the devil to prey on you and cause you to rebel against your maker.</p>
<p>Let us examine part of the main scriptures again
<br> <br> 15: – And<strong> I </strong>will put <strong>enmity</strong> between <strong>thee and the woman</strong>, and between <strong>thy seed</strong> and <strong>her seed;</strong> it shall <strong>bruise thy head</strong>, and thou shalt <strong>bruise his heel"</strong>. </p>
<p>Jesus in Mt4:3-11 showed us the pattern of the victory over satan. <br> <br>
<em>“3: - And when the tempter came to Him, he said, if thou be the Son of God, command that these stones be made bread.  4:- But He answered and said, it is written, Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God.  5:- Then the devil taketh him up into the holy city and setteth Him on a pinnacle of the temple,  6:- And saith unto Him, if thou be the Son of God, cast thyself down: for it is written, He shall give His angels charge concerning thee: and in their hands they shall bear thee up, lest at any time thou dash thy foot against a stone. 7:- Jesus said unto him, it is written again, thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God. 8:- Again, the devil taketh Him up into an exceeding high mountain, and sheweth Him all the kingdoms of the world, and the glory of them. 9:- And saith unto Him, All these things will I give thee, if thou will fall down worship me.  10:- Then saith Jesus unto him, Get thee hence, satan: for it is written, thou shalt <strong> worship </strong> the Lord thy God, and Him only shalt thou serve. 11:- Then the devil leaveth him, and behold, angels came and ministered unto Him.</em> </p>
<p>This is how Jesus bruised the head of satan through the truth (spoken and written word of God) and satan bruised Jesus heel through the suffering of condemnation to the cross by Judas deception and Israel’s ignorance to hand over Jesus to be crucified on the cross. Jesus never yield to any of satan’s lies because He knew the word of the Lord is always true and that in it victory is assured. Truth overcomes lies always. </p>
<p> <strong>NB: The true meaning of worship is believe</strong> </p>
<p>Who will you believe (worship) today? God’s word or devil’s lies?
<br> The only victory of man over the devil in this war is the word of God because it is the truth and lies cannot stand where the truth is existing.
</p>
<p> <strong>NB: The only personality prophesied by God to defeat the devil is the woman’s seed. That the reason of the new birth (being born again).</strong> </p>
<p>You can defeat the devil on your own except when you become the woman’s seed who is the truth Jesus. That why Jesus said it in John 14:6 “I am the way, the truth and the life, ……”. This is because He understood that the <strong>only way, truth and life </strong> for man’s victory is Him (the woman’s seed) that has the ability to bruise the head of the devil. Never trade Jesus for the devil.
<br> <br>
There are three things the life of Jesus taught us from the wilderness temptation;
<br>1.	Understanding the truth (the word of God – Jesus the truth)
<br>2.	Believing and confess it  (the way)
<br>3.	Live it (the life)
<br> <br> We can’t have this victory except if we are born again. That is we die for Jesus to live in us through the ministry of the Holy Spirit. It is then we can say boldly that it is no longer we that live but Christ in us because in that, we have become the woman’s seed who had victory. Why we must be born again is because the seed of man has being corrupted by devil’s lies in the Garden of Eden.
 </p>
 <p>Let us consider the following scriptures:  <br>
John 3:3 : - Jesus answered and said unto him, verily, verily, I say unto thee, except a <strong> man be born again,</strong>
he cannot see the kingdom of God.        1Peter 1:23 : - <strong>  Being born again, </strong>  not of corruptible seed,
 but of incorruptible, by the <strong> word of God,</strong>  which <strong> liveth and abideth for ever.</strong>
  Galatians 2:20 : - <strong> I am crucified with Christ</strong>  nevertheless <strong> I live, yet not I,</strong>  but <strong>  Christ in me:</strong>
	the life which <strong> I now live </strong>  in the flesh, <strong> I live</strong>  by the </strong> faith of the Son of God </strong>, who loved me,
	and gave himself for me.        Luke 4:18 : -<strong>  The Spirit of the Lord</strong>  is upon <strong> Me</strong> , because <strong> He anointed
	 me </strong> to <strong> preach </strong>  the <strong> gospel to the poor</strong> ; He hath <strong> sent me</strong>  to <strong> heal the broken-hearted,</strong>  to <strong>  preach
	 deliverance </strong>  to the <strong> captives,</strong>  and <strong> recovering </strong> the <strong> sight </strong>  to <strong> the blind</strong> , to </strong> set at liberty them that are
	  bruised.</strong>   Other scriptures we can read; Acts 10:38, Isaiah 53:5-10, Romans 16:17-20, Colossians 3:3.
</p>
<p>Jesus is the victory of man. You can only have victory if Jesus dwells in you. Are you born again in Christ Jesus? If “no”, do that now so that the devil can stop cheating you with lies and deception. If you want to take that decision we me now, you can say the declare the following words;
<br><br>“Thank you Lord for the privilege you gave me through Jesus. I confess today by the declaration of my mouth that I accept Jesus as my Lord and Saviour, I believe He died and resurrected for my sake for life. Come into my Life and live in me through Your Holy Spirit. This day I reject devil’s lies and embrace You the truth of God in Jesus. Amen”.
</p>
<p>If you took that decision with me, I want to congratulate you as heaven is rejoicing over you and I assure you, this is a decision any man can regret. God be with you richly in Jesus name. </p>
